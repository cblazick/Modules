Python modules I've written to make my, and anyone elses, life easier

<p>ansi - off the shelf module to do simple terminal text manipulations
        (e.g. color, blink, etc.)</p>

        suggesting possible alternate spellings for what was entered
emailer - various ways of sending mail. will support html
        messages and attachments in the future
globals - universal globals to allow configuring common values on
        multiple packages at once.  edit GLOBALS for your application
sequence - used to input file sequences in human reqdable format and do
        operations such as transforming it to other style descriptions
